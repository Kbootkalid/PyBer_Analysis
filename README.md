# PyBer_Analysis

# The written analysis has the following:
# Overview of the analysis:
### Using Python we are told to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, we were told to apply the skills we learned in Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

# The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. 

##  The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates. beased on our findings to share finds so the can be more informed.

# Results:
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

## In our findings urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
## In the same findings urban cities also have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.
## However suburban cities have 6x + drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
## Another things was that rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.
## In conclusion the summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides.


# Summary:
## There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
### Based on the analysis, my personal recommendations to Pyber are: first and foremost to increase the amount of drivers in Rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. As we have seen in it, the data we analyzed  for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities.This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
